## Overview of Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. PyBer operates in three different types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. In module we did analysis on multiple different criteria by city: Total # of rides, Average fare, Average # of Drivers. We also compared % of drivers and % of rides by city type. For this challenge, we took it a step further and created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. Then we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

#### Summary Data
![Summary DataFrame](https://github.com/dhaval-28/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Images/PyBer_DataFrame-Deliverable1.png)

Ride-sharing data Analysis:

(1) Total rides:  Urban city type has the greatest number of rides while Rural city type has very small number of rides.
(2) Total drivers:  Urban city type has majority of drivers, while Rural City type has very few drivers.
(3) Total fares: similar to total rides and total drivers, Urban City type leads in Total fares as well.
(4) Average fare per ride: Rural city types fetch more fare per ride compare to Suburban. And Suburban city type fetches more fare per ride compare to Urban City type.
(5) Average fare per driver: Rural drivers get more fares compare to Suburban. And Suburban drivers get more fare compare to Urban City type.

#### Multiple-line graph

Multiple-line graph compares total fares by city type over a period of four months. The total fare  goes to peak in beginning of the last week in Feburary in all three city types. In Rural area it goes even more higher in beginning of April.  Rest of the months total fare fluctuates. 

## Summary
(1) Average fare per driver : There is a huge disparities in average fare per driver by city type. The average fare per driver is too low in Urban area. CEO should consider limiting number of drivers in urabn area to address this disparities.

(2) Number of Drivers & Total fare : Number of drivers in rural area are too less compare to Urban area. Increasing number of drivers in rural area could help increase total fare in rural area.

(3) There was a sharp decline in total fare from suburban area in beginning of March. There was a sharp increase in total fare from Rural area in beginning of April. The reasons behind this sharp decline and increase should be investigated and possibly used for future strategy to improve total fare.
