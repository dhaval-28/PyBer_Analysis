## Overview of Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. PyBer operates in three different types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. In module we did analysis on multiple different criteria by city : Total # of rides,Average fare, Average # of Drivers. We also compared % of drivers and % of rides by city type. For this challenge, we took it a step further and created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. Then we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

#### Summary Data
![Summary DataFrame](https://github.com/dhaval-28/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Images/PyBer_DataFrame-Deliverable1.png)

Ride-sharing data Analysis :

(1) Total rides :  Urban city type has the most number of rides while Rural city type has very small nulber of rides.
(2) Total drivers :  Urban city type has majority of drivers , while Rural City type has very few drivers.
(3) Total fares : similar to total rides and total drivers, Urban City type leads in Total fares as well.
(4) Average fare per ride : Rural city types fetch more fare per ride compare to Suburban. And Suburban city type fetches more fare per ride compare to Urban City type.
(5) Average fare per driver : Rural drivers get more fares compare to Suburban. And Suburban drivers get more fare compare to Urban City type.
